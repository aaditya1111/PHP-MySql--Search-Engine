Google and bing are famous search engines used by all over the world. The most important part of any portal is itâ€™s effective search where one needs to fetch some data from the database.  Usage :  1.) Used During My CBIX Summer Internship to display results according to the user's query.  2.) Every client entered data via a form based on which results were shown to him.  Note :  1.) This is a dummy database.  2.) Exact project description details can be discussed but not shared on accounts of Copyright issues.
